## 🔍 About Me

I am a dedicated Data Science aspirant currently pursuing a B.S. in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras, with a strong academic background in mathematics. I possess practical experience in machine learning, data visualization, and business analytics, and have worked on several projects involving end-to-end data pipelines, dashboard development, and model optimization. My core interest lies in extracting meaningful insights from complex data and building solutions that support data-driven decision-making.

🔎 I turn **raw data into insights**, whether it's optimizing sales with Power BI, building machine learning pipelines, or designing full-stack quiz platforms.

💡 I believe:  
> **"Data evolves into knowledge, and knowledge unlocks power."**
